"Hollywood Pizza on 156st. has an absolutely Awesome Hollywood Special.

It's loaded. It's huge. It's everything you want in a pizza.

That's coming from a guy who remembers Rosebowl Pizza in their hay day. They're gone now but set the bar for pizza in this town.

In my humble opinion. Naturally.","Ordered for lunch large 2 topping, 12"" sub and donair.
3/5 yelp pizza was ok, you can skip the donair and sub, fail.
Didn't get the 10% discount for pickup, don't know why. Take another star away.

Probably will not go back.","Hollywood Pizza consistently has my back. I always want to believe a better option may be out there and spend time searching, then trying a new place, then realize most are epic fails. HPD is simple with a menu of items that goes on for days. We have generally stuck to the simple items and can't complain. Keep it up HPD, high five for accommodating our late night needs with your awesome hours.",The place isn't much to look at...but the pizza is great. A lot of bang for your  buck at Hollywood.  It may look like a a bit of a greasy spoon that's off the beaten path (and it is) - don't let that deter you. A family operated business that has become a regular favourite to many people. This restaurant won't be one of the city's best kept secrets for long.,I ordered the donair pizza a while back and I've had MUCH better donair pizzas before. I thought I'd give them another try but I have to say I am super annoyed that I have to go through two authentications to make sure I'm not a robot before I can access their site. Second extremely annoying thing is that their website is in euros! What the hell??? The address is Edmonton but the website is in euros!,"I've ordered from Hollywood Pizza & Donair a couple of times now, and get the same great service and product each time! The prices are great and the pizza is delicious. Their pies do seem a little smaller than average but that's fine by me! I've tried the lasagna and it didn't thrill me, but everything else has been great. One of these days I'll try the donair :) The other thing that really impressed me was the delivery- really fast and if you spend the minimum it's free!",Delivery time was good they got it to the door hot but the pizza not so good . Tried donair and pep which is as basic as it gets and the crust is tasteless and sauce is just ok.  Sweet sauce need to be thicker is was water as well. 2 stars would have been a gift so I gave 1.,We order from here all the time. The prices are great and their pizza is really good. It isn't a fancy place but well worth it! The family that runs it is also friendly and kind,"Good food and good price, been going there for years. I love their donair pizza and spring rolls! Their green onion cakes and dry ribs are also a must try. And when you pick up, it's 10% off!! Highly recommend","Awesome! Good food, great prices! Compared to other places like it I'd say this has been the best. Can always rely on the food being hot and good."
